# Problem Description:
Pari wants to buy an expensive chocolate from Arya. She has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is ci. The price of the chocolate is k, so Pari will take a subset of her coins with sum equal to k and give it to Arya.

Looking at her coins, a question came to her mind: after giving the coins to Arya, what values does Arya can make with them? She is jealous and she doesn't want Arya to make a lot of values. So she wants to know all the values x, such that Arya will be able to make x using some subset of coins with the sum k.

Formally, Pari wants to know the values x such that there exists a subset of coins with the sum k such that some subset of this subset has the sum x, i.e. there is exists some way to pay for the chocolate, such that Arya will be able to make the sum x using these coins.
